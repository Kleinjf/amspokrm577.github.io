            width: 50%;

            height: 50vh;
            font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

                My first example of following the instructions came with the use of external stylesheets and
                scripts. Though my early attempts at this static site included JS. I realized that many of the 
                features could be done by simply using more advanced media queries and markup. Nonetheless, my 
                .js file contains an attempt at a user created event. This would come from a hover or click. 
                For my css, I would mainly define colors, borders, spacing and positioning within the page.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="para">
            <p>
                As mentioned before, I included media queries to make the site responsive to user preference (phone/laptop). The Page
                can shrink showing how certain properties of existing html elements can become "responsive" by
                changing at will. My site also includes forms for the user to input something, an Image folder to 
                contain images to be placed in certain areas for the user. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="para">
            <p>
                Lastly the page contains a central theme, a favicon, and a css animation. For my central theme, I went with a stock market.
                This has a focus of appealing to the students interested in investing money. This site takes a humorous approach in 
                making fun of certain stereotypes in this business world and juxtaposition. The favicon was an image of Matthew
                Mcconaughey (alright, alright, alright), the animation is a marquee at the top of the viewport.
